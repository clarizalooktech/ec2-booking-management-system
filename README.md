- Automatic creation of user credentials
- Provisioning of EC2 instances with JupyterHub
- Email notifications with booking and instance details
- Scheduled shutdown of EC2 instances

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables in a [.env](http://_vscodecontentref_/41) file:
    ```env
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DEBUG=True
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
    DB_NAME=your_db_name
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_HOST=your_db_host
    DB_PORT=5432
    TIME_ZONE=your_time_zone
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_aws_default_region
    ```

5. Run database migrations:
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
